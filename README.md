# GIVE
*Web App built at Rose Hack 2019 - Awarded Best Use of MongoDB üèÖ*

## About
GIVE is a web app that connects non-profit organizations with individuals intending to make goods-based donations (bedding, clothing, food, etc). Consumer culture encourages everyone to overspend and overbuy. Often, people end up with more goods than they actually need. GIVE provides individuals with the opportunity to donate these extra materials as opposed to wasting or neglecting them.
